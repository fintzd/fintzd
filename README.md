## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

According to Github, this is what I should write about:

But let's be honest, for now I'm a bit too lazy to do all that, which you probably realized by reading up until this point. Wow you really made it to this far? Well congratulations, really, kudos to you. But now you can stop. Really. Please stop. Okay then, I tried to warn you, but there really is nothing here to see. sorry for wasting you time! Have a great day! 

Sorry, promise I'll get back to this at some point.

If you did manage to read up until this point, or even just jump right here with those wonderful eyeballs of you, then I won't just leave you hanging. Check out [these](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) amazing Github profile README files (according to the contributors at least, didn't check all of them myself I can assure you). 

Cheers,

David
